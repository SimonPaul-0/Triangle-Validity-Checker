# Triangle Validity Checker
## Overview

The Triangle Validity Checker is a Python program designed to determine if a triangle with a positive area is possible based on user-provided angles. It checks whether the sum of the angles is 180 degrees and each angle is greater than 0, ensuring the validity of the triangle.
## How to Use
### 1. Run the program in a Python environment:
  ```bash
  python triangle_checker.py
  ```
### 2. Enter the three angles when prompted.
### 3. The program will output whether a triangle with a positive area is possible or not based on the provided angles.
## Example

  ```bash
  python triangle_checker.py

  Enter the first angle: 45
  Enter the second angle: 45
  Enter the third angle: 90

  A triangle with positive area is possible.

  ```
## Note
- Ensure that the input angles are positive, and their sum is equal to 180 degrees for a valid triangle.
- This program serves as a basic tool for checking triangle validity based on angles.
