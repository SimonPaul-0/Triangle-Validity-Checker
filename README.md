# Triangle Validity Checker

This Python program checks if a triangle with positive area is possible based on the given angles. The sum of the angles must be 180 degrees, and each angle should be greater than 0 for a valid triangle.

## How to Use

1. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python triangle_checker.py
    ```

2. Enter the angles when prompted.

3. View the result, which indicates whether a triangle with positive area is possible.

## Example

```bash
python triangle_checker.py

Enter the first angle: 45
Enter the second angle: 45
Enter the third angle: 90

A triangle with positive area is possible.
```

## Note

This program validates whether the entered angles can form a valid triangle and outputs the result accordingly. Feel free to customize or integrate it into your projects.
