# Triangle Validity Checker
## Overview

The Triangle Validity Checker is a Python program designed to determine if a triangle with a positive area is possible based on user-provided angles. It checks whether the sum of the angles is 180 degrees and each angle is greater than 0, ensuring the validity of the triangle.
## How to Use
- Run the program in a Python environment.
- Enter the three angles when prompted.
- The program will output whether a triangle with a positive area is possible or not based on the provided angles.

## Example

  ```bash
  Enter the first angle: 60
  Enter the second angle: 70
  Enter the third angle: 50
  ```
Output:

  ```csharp
  A triangle with positive area is possible.
  ```
## Note
- Ensure that the input angles are positive, and their sum is equal to 180 degrees for a valid triangle.
- This program serves as a basic tool for checking triangle validity based on angles.
